Hello!
<br>
We're Ashni and Ariel, two students at Rutgers University, majoring in Computer Science.
<br>
This is our final project for CS336 - but it's also much more than just a semester project.
<br>
We thought it'd be interesting to explore <b>incidences of gun violence</b> across the nation, and link in some <b>data that isn't usually included </b> when discussing gun violence.
We collected a lot of data, some more interesting than others: how strict a state's gun laws are, the <b>average unemployment rate</b> in a state, abortion availability,
the state's <b>political leanings</b>, incidences of gun violence (separated by type of gun), and more.
<br>
<br>
<mark> Note: Data surrounding murders by different types of guns was not available for Florida.</mark> Our data comes from the FBI's Crime in the United States Report, which relies on data 
that is submitted through the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. In multiple years (including the most recent one), the supplemental homicide data submitted by the Florida state UCR Program
did not meet UCR guidelines and was not included in the FBI table (Table 20 of the Crime in the US index).
